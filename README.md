# Sort Spectacle

Sort Spectacle is a Swift/SwiftUI app demonstrating visually how different sorting algorithms behave.

Currently Bubble sort, Lamp sort and Quick sort are implemented.

## To do

Another view for app settings:

* How many numbers to sort (slider?)
* Range of numbers to sort, from 1 > or -n...n
* Random numbers or sequences
* Visuals; lines (currently implemented) or dots being animated.

Also, more functionality:

1. More sorting algorithms
1. Better visuals, like line width, highlighting the numbers compared just now
1. Sounds, generated from sort status data.
1. Adjusting speed, depending on array size and animations
