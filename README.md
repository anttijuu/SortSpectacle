# Sort Spectacle

Sort Spectacle is an iOS app demonstrating visually how different sorting algorithms behave.

Currently only Bubble Sort is implemented. Array size and number ranges are hard coded.

## To do

Another view for setting

* How many numbers to sort
* Range, from 1 > or -n...n
* Random numbers or sequences

Also, more functionality

1. More sorting algorithms
1. Better visuals, like line width, highlighting the numbers compared just now
1. Sounds
1. Adjusting speed, depending on array size and animations
