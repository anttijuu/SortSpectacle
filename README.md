# Sort Spectacle

Sort Spectacle is a Swift/SwiftUI app demonstrating visually how different sorting algorithms behave.

Currently Bubble sort, Lamp sort and Quick sort are implemented. Additionally, Swift Foundation array's sort() is called, to compare performance in the final step of the demonstration. Array.sort() implements Timsort (AFAIK).

## How to use

Clone the repo, build using Xcode and run either in simulator or in a real device (iPhone, iPad, macOS). 

Please note that you should build the app in Release configuration to make it run full speed without debugging stuff inside. 

## To do

More sorting methods. E.g. restructure Timsort from Foundation source code to execute step by step.

Better settings / configuration to select: 

- count of numbers to sort
- fancy graphics to display
- adjusting speed, depending on array size
