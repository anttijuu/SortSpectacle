/**
 SortCoordinator coordinates, as the name implies, sorting of arrays using different sorting methods.
 It is an `ObservableObject`, being observerd by a `View` that holds the coordinator as an `@ObservedObject`
 to show the state of the sorting in the UI.
 
 SortCoordinator:
  - holds the array to be sorted, giving it to each sort method by calling SortMethod.nextStep().
  - times the sorting process using a `Timer`
  - publishes the array to the Views so that when the array is updated, view is redrawn.
  - collects the timing results using `SortMethod.realAlgorithm(...)`, to show to the user the time the algoritms
 take to sort the array without any animations.
 
 SortCoordinator is to be used so that the client (a SwiftUI View):
 
 1. creates the SortCoordinator object
 1. calls `execute()` when user is tapping some element in the UI
 1. reacts to the events in the SortCoordinator when the array within changes, by updating the UI
 1. calls `stop()` if user wants to stop the sorting by tapping in the View.
 
 For details, see the properties and methods in this class as well as the `SortMethod` protocol which all the sorting methods implement.
